#Mosquito

Mosquito is both a program and an API framework for benchmarking SPARQL Endpoints.
On one side it provides the ability to benchmark different SPARQL endpoints (e.g. triplestores) with 
given or generated datasets and predefined test cases on the other side it provides a framework and API 
to implement either a complete different benchmark or just parts of the benchmark (e.g. own test cases).
